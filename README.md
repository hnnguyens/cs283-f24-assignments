FINAL PROJECT: FREDDIE GAME
How to Play:
Collect the fish and don't let Freddie catch you! Explore the apartment, but be warned as Freddie gets faster as the time increases. Click R to restart and Q to quit. The space bar will toggle the instruction box on or off if you forget the rules! If you complete the level, you can try to beat your previous time :)
