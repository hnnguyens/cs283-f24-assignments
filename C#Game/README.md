# Your README for A2 HERE
FLEE! Game instructions & Content:
- Click on the 'W' or 'Up' keys to toggle the player. The ball will jump with each click.
- Avoid the moving platforms!
- To replay the game, press enter.
- The '+' key produces the signature box in the upper left hand corner.

- FLEE! uses three classes, one for the game loop, one for the player, and one for the obstacles. The obstacles are initialized at random coordinates on the right side of the screen and move at a fixed rate towards the player. The player's update method causes them to consistently fall, unless prompted by the user to jump. It is game over in two instances: if the player falls off the screen or if the ball collides with a platform.
- Note: I wanted to import my own drawings for the game based off of designs for a flappy bird demo I was working on in Unity, but I couldn't figure out the colissions with the size of the png image. I also would have added a timer or a scoring system...maybe next time. I attached the drawings for reference!
